Type: Package
Title: Spatial Prediction of Fire Risk
Description: This package implements the wildfire risk mapping method of Price et al.
  (2015). Given a set of locations for which to assess risk; a model relating fire
  risk to landscape variables; and a set of raster layers for those variables; the
  package provides functions to scan the neighbourhood of each location and apply
  the given model to estimate the point risk.
